# Protein-Lifetime-Project
This python script allows the user to get the protein lifetime in the cell following the N-end rule, by which the protein half-life is calculated by the last aminoacid in the protein sequence.

## Background
The N-end rule was first described by Alexander Varshavsky and his team in the ninties. It relates the in vivo half-life of a protein to the indentity of its N-terminal residue. He concluded that similar but distinct versions of the N-end rule operate in all organisms, from mammals, to fungi to bacteria. Therefore, according to this, it should be possible to calculate the half-life of a protein from a protein sequence and estimate the life-time of the protein in the cell using a bioinformatic approach.
